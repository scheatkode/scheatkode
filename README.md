<h2 align="center">:vulkan_salute: Hey there !</h2>

I'm scheatkode, a self-taught, software engineering enthusiast  interested  in
all things computer related ranging from low-level programming to  programming
language theory and  design  patterns  and  everything  in  between,  such  as
software security, DevOps, networking, and much more.

Sounds like too much ? It's because I've been a programmer, a tinkerer, and an
avid  learner  since  very  young.  I've  also  been  a  Systems  &   Networks
administrator by profession at some point. Explains a lot, doesn't it ?

Feel free to have a look around !
