<h2 align="center">:vulcan_salute: Hey there !</h2>

I'm scheatkode, a self-taught software engineer interested in all things
computer-related ranging from low-level hackery to programming language theory
and design patterns as well as everything in between, such as software
security, DevOps, networking, and much more.

Sounds like too much ? It's because I've been a programmer, tinkerer, and avid
learner since very young. I've also been a Systems & Networks administrator by
profession at some point. Explains a lot, doesn't it ?

Feel free to have a look around, although you won't find much; I left this
place for good a few years ago.

The reason isn't too far fetched; classic *"don't be evil"* moment. This
account exists solely for the occasional open source contribution; I don't
keep my stuff here anymore.

I like *sharing knowledge with humans* and contributing to the betterment of
our species. I'm not interested in feeding the capitalistic money machine.

You may occasionally find me on [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/) but
chances are I'll be focusing on private projects for the foreseeable future.

On that note, *See You Space Cowboy*.
